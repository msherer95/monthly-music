Monthly Music is a web app that simplifies your concert search. While Spotify displays upcoming concerts, it only does so a specific artist's playlist. 

Monthly Music uses the Spotify API to extract all tracks from all of a user's playlists. This includes their saved tracks, their personally curated playlists, and any other shared playlists they might be associated with. 

It then searches for any upcoming concerts some specified months ahead, within a specified radius, via the Ticketmaster API. 

It then displays all unique concerts, with links to the Ticketmaster site where you can purchase tickets.
